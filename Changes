  Support whitespace inside [] if /xx in effect.
    Starting with Perl 5.25.9, a space or tab appearing inside a bracketed
    character class is not significant if /xx is asserted.

  Further deprecate tokenizer method prior()

  Add 'provides' data to ExtUtils::MakeMaker output

  SOME unescaped litaral '{' removed in 5.025001.
    After '.', Unicode classes, and bracketed classes (including extended)
    they are still legal.

  Make /\b{/ an error
    Perl fails to parse the above, because once it sees the '\b{' it wants
    to find one of the extended boundary assertions (like \b{wb}), and
    declares an error when it does not. So we check for this and rebless the
    curly into an unknown token, not a literal.

0.050		2016-05-06	T. R. Wyant
  Parse bracketed substitution with embedded comment. This is something
    like s{foo}\n#{bar}\n{baz} which is equivalent to s/foo/baz/. PPI
    gets this wrong, and we're not smart enough to fix up the PPI parse,
    but if given this as text, we now parse it correctly.

  We now recognize postfix dereferences by default, since Perl does
    beginning with 5.24. In other words, default new() argument
    'postderef' to true.

  Unterminated substitutions (i.e. 's//') should no longer cause an
    exception. Instead they parse as an unknown token.

  Robustify PPIx::Regexp->perl_version_removed()
    The problem here was that if the expression being parsed was
    sufficiently badly-formed, $self->delimiters() would be undef, throwing
    a warning.

  Correct dump of embedded modifiers (eg: (?i:...))

0.048		2016-02-29	T. R. Wyant
  Add option 'strict', like 'use re "strict"'
    In the presence of strict(), I opted to set perl_version_introduced
    to the version of Perl where the construct became an error.

  Parse '\N{}' as no-op.
    The previous parse was a character class ('\N') followed by two
    literals ('{' and '}'). But perl5238delta said that it had been
    ignored up to that time. Starting with 5.23.8 it is an error if 'use
    re strict' is in effect.

  Quash 'NOT a POSIX class ...' warning under 5.23.8

  Add Makefile targets authortest and testcover.

0.047		2016-01-29	T. R. Wyant
  Recognize \b{lb}, introduced in 5.23.7. If this is retracted before

  Deprecate tokenizer method prior() in favor of
    prior_significant_token(). This is not part of the public interface,
    so I suppose I could have just slam-dunked it, but ...

  Add ability to parse strings as well as regexes
    The new functionality is controlled by the new new() argument
    'parse', whose permitted values are 'regex' (the default), 'string',
    or 'guess'.  String parsing, and the 'string' and 'guess' values of
    'parse', are experimental.

0.044		2015-12-08	T. R. Wyant
  Allow nesting of \Q with \U, \L, and \F
    The perlop docs say these nest with each other. Playing with Perl
    suggests that \U, \L and \F supersede each other, but thet they as a
    group nest with \Q in either order, so that if you specify \Q and
    one of the \U, \L, \F group you need two \Es to turn them all back
    off.

  Restrict recognition of back references in replacement strings to
    \number form, since Perl itself does not recognize \g{...} or
    \k{...} there.

  Recognize postfix dereference if desired. This is controlled by the
    Boolean argument 'postderef' passed to PPIx::Regexp->new(). The
    default is false, but will become true if postfix dereference
    becomes mainstream Perl 5.

  Add explain() and supporting methods main_structure() and
    in_regex_set(). The explain() method returns a brief explanation of
    what the element does.

0.043		2015-11-18	T. R. Wyant
  Do not end regex set prematurely on finding '])'
    The problem is that '])' can occur within an extended bracketed
    character class if it contains grouping parentheses and the last
    item in a group is a regular bracketed character class and there is
    no white space between the end of the character class and the end of
    the group.

  Record parse failure if switch condition is unknown
    The structure was being reblessed to
    PPIx::Regexp::Structure::Unknown, but the number of parse failures
    was not being incremented.

  Parse \U and friends as meta-characters inside \Q...\E
    This turns out to be what Perl itself does, as shown by
    $ perl -E 'say qr{\Q\Ufoo}'

  Clear error when lexer identifies unknown token. Those who peruse the
    changes in this release will see that a bunch of refactoring was
    done as part of this.

  Parse white space inside bracketed character classes inside extended
    bracketed character classes (whew!) as literals, except for the
    space character itself and the horizontal tab. This tracks the
    corresponding change in Perl 5.23.4. This will be reverted if the
    corresponding Perl change does not make it into 5.24.0.

  Beginning with version 0.035, PPIx::Regexp was incorrectly reporting
    the sense of modifiers when the same token both asserted and negated
    modifiers (e.g. '(?x-i:...)'). This release should correct the
    problem.

  Document policy when Perl changes in such a way that the proper parse
    for a regular expression changes. In this case the more modern parse
    is preferred.

0.042		2015-10-09	T. R. Wyant
  Report error rather than failing when parsing a string consisting
    wholly of white space.

  Group types were not being recognized if they contained the delimiter
    character for the regexp (e.g. in qr<(?\<foo)> the look-behind
    assertion was not recognized as such).

  Correct mis-parse of ' s///'. Leading white space is supposed to be
    acceptable, but the leading whitespace token caused
    PPIx::Regexp::Lexer not to recognize the substitution as such.

  Tokenizer was failing when the string to be parsed was so bad it was
    trying to return the whole thing as a single
    PPIx::Regexp::Token::Unknown.

  PPIx::Regexp::Dumper now displays a message if a structure is missing
    its end delimiter.

  RT 107331 Produce parse error in the presence of trailing cruft.
    Thanks to Klaus Rindfrey for catching this.
    The tokenizer now does a preliminary scan for delimiting brackets
    and modifiers. Anything after the modifiers except for white space
    is now made into a PPIx::Regexp::Token::Unknown, resulting in a
    parse failure being reported. The previous implementation simply
    assumed a valid expression, and in the case of the expression in the
    ticket blithely mismatched the delimiters and returned a parse
    without failures, but which was manifestly bogus.

  Tweak documentation in PPIx::Regexp.

0.041		2015-07-02	T. R. Wyant
  Report \C (match octet) as removed in 5.23.0.

  Accept non-ASCII whitespace under /x. The Whitespace object can be
    multiple characters; the perl_version_introduced() becomes
    '5.021001' if any of them is a code point above 127.

  The perl_version_removed() method now returns '5.021001' when called
    on a PPIx::Regexp object produced by parsing '?foo?' (match once
    without explicit 'm'). The object produced by parsing 'm?foo?' still
    returns the minimum Perl version.

0.040		2015-05-31	T. R. Wyant
  Do not parse unadorned parentheses as capture groups when /n is in
    effect. Instead, they are parsed as PPIx::Regexp::Structure. Named
    captures appear to be unaffected by /n.

  Made a verbose dump a little more so. Specifically, dump
    max_capture_group where relevant, and display dumped values a bit
    more informatively.

  Report /n (no captures) as having been added in 5.21.8.

  Recognize nested subscripts in interpolation.
    Thanks to Andy Lester for finding this, which actually manifested in
    Perl-Critic-Policy-Variables-ProhibitUnusedVarsStricter. The problem is
    that the actual heuristics for finding the end of an interpolation are
    undocumented, and I missed this rather-obvious case.

  Add \b{g} (= \b{gcb})

0.038		2015-03-09	T. R. Wyant
  Make \b{foo} into an unknown token (and therefore an error. This
    applies to \b{anything}, where 'anything' is anything bur 'gcb',
    'wb', or 'sb'.

  Handle the boundary assertions introduced in Perl 5.21.9: '\b{gcb}'
    (grapheme cluster boundary), '\b{wb}' (word boundary), '\b{sb}'
    (sentence boundary), and the corresponding '\B{...}' constructions.
    Similar-looking things like '\b{foo}' are not recognized as
    assertions, and end up being literals.  This is less general than I
    usually make things, but was done against the possibility that
    (e.g.) '\b{foo}' might be introduced later, requiring
    perl_version_released() to return a different number. Any of these
    retracted prior to Perl 5.22.0 will simply be removed from
    PPIx::Regexp.

0.037		2014-11-12	T. R. Wyant
  Have PPIx::Regexp::Structure::RegexSet POD recognize that the Perl

    Extended Bracketed Character Classes, not sets.

  Correctly mark the replacement portion of s///ee as code. Prior to
    this release it was parsed as though no /e were present.

  Make available the number of times a given modifier is asserted
    (except for the match semantics modifiers which get handled
    differently). See PPIx::Regexp::Token::Modifier->asserted() and
    PPIx::Regexp::Tokenizer->modifier() for details.

  Properly handle multi-character modifiers like /ee. We now handle /eie
    as being the same as /eei. Thanks to Anonymous Monk for finding
    this.

  Properly handle \g and \k back references that do not correspond to an
    actual capture group. They are now reblessed into the unknown token,
    and counted as errors. Thanks to Anonymous Monk for finding this.

  Add method error() to PPIx::Regexp::Element. This should return an
    error message when the element is in error -- normally when it has
    been blessed into the unknown token or structure.

  Add method modifier_asserted() to PPIx::Regexp::Element. This walks
    the parse tree backward to determine if the given modifier is in

  Add Regex Sets, which were added to Perl as an experimental feature in
    5.17.8. This is experimental in Perl, therefore the parse may
    change.

  Ditch PPIx::Regexp::Token::GroupType method __expect_after_match() in
    favor of the more general __match_setup(). This is done without
    deprecation because __expect_after_match() was documeted as
    package-private, but noted in the change log because it _was_
    documented.

    Alexandr Ciornii for finding more of these.

  Fix mis-parse of /(\?|I)/ as a branch reset (it's really an

  Correct various documentation errors.

  Don't initialize effective modifiers with '^', since that wrongly
    asserts that /d has been seen somewhere along the line.

  Implement negation of match-semantic modifiers (e.g. 'no re /u;') by
    setting the relevant datum to undef.

  Support for default modifiers. This includes:

    * default_modifiers argument to new() in PPIx::Regexp,
      PPIx::Regexp::Tokenizer, and PPIx::Regexp::Dumper

    * Public method modifier_asserted() on PPIx::Regexp, to return
      whether a given modifier is actually in effect. The results of the
      modifier() method are unchanged.

  Require Test::More 0.88 for installation. Eliminate all the 'eval
    { require ... }' logic in favor of 'use Test::More 0.88'.

  Have Makefile.PL make use of {BUILD_REQUIRES} if it is available.

  Ensure that \N{$foo} parses as a Unicode literal, not a quantified \N.
    The ordinal() method returns undef for this.

  Understand the /aa modifier, introduced with 5.13.10.

  Report perl_version_introduced() of 5.013010 for the new semantic

  Override ppi() in PPIx::Regexp::Token::Interpolation to provide the
    proper PPI when variable names are bracketed.

  Properly parse bracketed variable names (I hope!), which may not be
    subscripted.

  Take account of possible '$' or '@' casts before a symbol in an
    interpolation (e.g. $$foo{bar}, which is equivalent to $foo->{bar}).

  Add the /a modifier to PPI::Regexp::Token::Modifiers, legal only in
    the (?:...) construction. This was introduced in Perl 5.13.9.

  When parsing an interpolation from a replacement string (rather than a
    regular expression), take subscripts at face value rather than
    trying to disambiguate them from quantifiers and character classes,
    which they can't be in this context.

  Declare a parse failure if characters are found between the '}' and

    not either.

  Whitespace tweak in the PPIx::Regexp::Dumper test output for the
    failures test.

  Replace the PPI logic in PPIx::Regexp::Token::Code with a call to
    $tokenizer->find_matching_delimiter(). This is actually the way Perl

  Push the perl_version_introduced() back to 5.0 at the request of

  PPIx::Regexp::Lexer no longer fails when encountering expressions like
    m{)}. Instead, it marks the right parenthesis as an unmatched
    delimiter.

  Fixed RT 56864 - PPIx::Regexp::Lexer fails in Perl::Critic under Perl
    5.13.0. This was due to the value of a returned $+[0] getting
    transmogrified before the caller saw it. I never did isolate what
    triggered the bug.

  Parse \N{...} in accordance with perl5115delta. The curlys must
    contain an alpha followed by alphanumerics, spaces, parens, colons,
    or dashes. \N{ without a matching } is a character class (if legal)
    followed by a literal '{'.

  Parse \N inside a character class as PPI::Regexp::Token::Unknown,
    since Perl 5.11.5 considers this a compile error. A \N{...} inside a
    character class is still OK.

  Add method match() to PPIx::Regexp::Tokenizer. This is analogous to
    capture(), but returns the entire matched string.
